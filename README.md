# Competitive Programming
Hi everyone, I'm a brazilian studant learning competitive programming, I'm 17 and I write code in c++.
This is my repository for competitive programming, hope you enjoy!
The main library I usually use for codeforces, and I plan to create a simpler version to print to the ICPC phases sometime.
